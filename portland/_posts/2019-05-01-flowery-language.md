Hello again! No, you’re not imagining it..I’m posting again before a month has gone by! I’m not drinking for the first 18 days of May, so I’m going to attempt to walk every day through this sad time in my life.

I started my walk with my visiting favorite haunt, the cemetery. While in there I walked through the thickest cloud of black flies. I kind of wished that I was dead when one flew in my mouth, I’m certain that the fly is though. 

My walk was largely uneventful until I saw a man peeing on the street. We had already locked eyes before I realized what was happening. So that was fun. This city can’t be all roses! But speaking of flowers. There are so many! I feel like a broken record talking about the flowers so much but seriously y'all….I've lived in the South, the East Coast, other parts of the West Coast, and I've never seen so many different blooms! They provide beauty and cover up the smell of pee on the streets. Now THAT’S multi-tasking! 

Please enjoy the following pictures of a few of the random blooms I saw on my walk. Urine blooms not included.
