I was very reflective  on my last walk today. I'm proud of myself for committing to my goal and succeeding. **I did it!** I’ve proven to myself that when I set my mind to something, I can achieve it. Did these walks cure my anxiety and all my problems? No. Did they take me out of my rushing thoughts and give me a moment of peace? Yes.

Today that weather was _perfect_, it felt as if the city wanted my last walk to be special. Chris and I stopped for bagels at a cafe called “Notes From Underground”, and it felt oddly appropriate. After all, that's all these blogs have been…notes from the city’s underground.

I knew that I wanted my last walk to be to the Palace of Fine Arts. The mock ruins never fail to amaze me and harken back to another century. The soaring columns are beautiful and the lagoon full of wild life. 

Built in 1915 for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, the lagoon at the front is a relic of San Francisco’s early landscape; a water-filled bog. Originally only built to last a year, the Palace of Fine Arts was rebuilt in the 60’s using the authentic moldings. It remains one of the few surviving structures from the Exposition.Y’all didn’t think that you’d get away without one last history lesson, did ya?

There is always a photoshoot or two happening at the Palace of Fine Arts. Chris and I actually had our engagement pictures taken here. We laid in the grass and watched dogs and babies enjoy the sunshine. Chris and I watched a funky looking bird troll a family having a picnic.  He was determined to steal a cheeto! We also got a kick out of watching people be scared of the birds flying near their heads. The Palace is a wildlife reserve, so one will see many different kinds of birds and turtles. I left with a sunburn, a smile, and no bird poop on me; success! 

I can’t believe today was my last day! I’ve really enjoyed this experience and appreciate everyone who has shared, commented, and followed along. I will most likely still write about some adventures here and there, but in the meantime I could use a foot rub from all this walking!

Going on these strolls have taught me so much about the city I live in. There are so many discoveries waiting to be walked by; all it takes is an hour.

The view from our blanket...not bad.
