A feeling of PRIDE fills the air  
One can feel it here and there  
Rainbow flags proudly fly  
Gripped between the fingers of passersby  
Today we celebrate with beauty and grace  
All of us united as one human race  
No one frowns, no one fears  
The air rings loudly with joyous cheers  
I walk around and all I see  
Is love and love growing like a tree  
An hour to reflect isn't much on the books  
But it allows one to really take a look  
Inside and outside yourself  
No emotion is allowed to be shelved  
Self discovery is important to me  
It allows me to truly be free  
Like the fiercest Queen at PRIDE  
We can all feel the changing tides  
They may be frustrating  
And they may be slow  
But I'm happy to participate in the show  
I love this city and its open arms  
I haven't yet tired of its charms
