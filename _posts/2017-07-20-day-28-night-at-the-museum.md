title: 'Day 28: Night At The Museum '
---
Tonight my hour was spent walking around the Science Museum and drinking beer with my friends! 
It was the perfect way to celebrate Friday Eve. 

Every Thursday the SF Science museum puts on a nighttime exhibit, and this week was “Beer Garden.” Although, now that I think about it we were so preoccupied with the science happening around us that we forgot to taste the beers in the garden.

Never fear though, we had beers! 

The beer I was drinking was actually brewed with the plants they grow on the roof of the building. It was slightly bitter and very tasty. I’ve only recently started drinking beer & I love it! I never would have thought I would say that a year or two ago, but I get it now. I think sour beers were the perfect bridge.

The museum was pretty crowded and difficult to walk through at times. It made me think about how even when I’m buzzed, I still try to be aware of being in the way of the people around me. I thought this was just common sense/courtsey but I was wrong. If walking in the city has taught me anything, it’s that most people don’t have time for anyone’s shit but their own. 

The event was 21+ and it was awesome! Chris and I tend to avoid museums like that during the day because they’re normally overrun with screaming children. Today it was just overrun with oblivious adults. I can deal with that! 

My feet were aching more at the end of tonight than any walk, but it was well worth it. My favorite part was the pterosaur exhibit or as I thought they were called “pterodactyl”. Apparently, Scientist avoid using that term. Those weird dinosaur birds look nothing like I imagined and were massive. 

This Thursday/walk was just what I needed; the laughs, the friends, the science, the beer! I’ve been dealing with night anxiety this week and having trouble sleeping, so it was wonderful to get my mind off of it. 

I think I may even get 8 hours of sleep tonight! Ohhh the things we wish for as adults….


PS) Jaclyn came up with today’s name! I told her I was going to steal the idea and not give her credit.

When we realized how original our fashion is.
