It hasn't been the easiest week for me personally. My walk today was very internal and I found myself constantly checking the time for when it would be over. I also found myself listening to the same song over and over again. A favorite song of mine, by AJJ, I thought I would share the lyrics. They seem to inherently fall into a common theme of my walks; people. 

People are wasteful, they waste all the food  
People are hateful, and people are rude  
But god I love some people sometimes  
Because people are very, very special  

And people are impatient, they donâ€™t know how to wait  
People are selfish, people are prone to hate  
But god I love some people sometimes  
Because people are the greatest thing to happen  

People are people regardless of skin  
People are people regardless of creed  
People are people regardless of gender  
People are people regardless of anything  

People are my religion because I believe in them  
People are my enemies and people are my friends  
I have faith in my fellow man  
And I only hope that he has faith in me
