Day three through six and I can’t deny that I’m missing my curling iron, and the polished look that is achieved with it. Frizz has been my number one enemy so far! I’m trying to find that delicate balance of enough product that I don’t look electrocuted, but not so much that I look oily. It is basically like walking a tightrope. 

I received an arsenal of new products earlier this week and decided to utilize a few of them in my morning routine which, by the way, has been cut in half! It’s honestly the best part of this whole thing. 

The first thing I’ve introduced is a microfiber towel, and I’m hoping this cuts back on the frizz. There are many options online, but I just went with the [Amazon basic version](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MT8781S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The other two products that I’ve used together are [DevaCurl Buildup Buster](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VWH1TP7/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) and [DevaCurl B’leave-In](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NE6PCA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)! The first is used in the shower and works to remove build-up from years of product on your scalp. I used this instead of shampoo and followed it up with a small amount of conditioner. Reviews have warned that this product can dry out your hair. I didn’t notice that today, but will only use weekly so it doesn’t happen. The B’leave-In is used after the shower on damp hair and I used it to shape my curls today. I noticed that my curls were a little more defined, and my hair is very soft. Both products smell amazing too! 

I finished out the week using B’leave-In & I’m still skeptical about it. It doesn’t do a bad job, but it hasn’t been doing a great job either. I feel like my hair is looking a little scraggly these days. I feel a bit like a stray dog who needs a bath. Today I used the third product that I purchased, [Tigi Bed Head On The Rebound Curl Recall Cream](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BQZ0PBC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and I think I like this one the most. I have more spirals than limp waves. It does feel too soon to tell though. I’m going to keep using these two products for the next week.

My biggest problem right now is not washing my hair too much. I prefer to wash it after the gym, but I feel like the frequent washings are not helping! The one time I didn’t wash my hair after the gym, it was a frizzy mess by the end of the day. _#firstcurlproblems_
