Day one started with a shower, Aveda Be Curly style prep, and a mostly unanswered prayer. 

I wasn’t really expecting to get much out of my hairstyle today. It was about as flat as flat earthers think our planet is, and had just the tiniest bit of wave to it. I used the product I’ve had laying around for awhile & didn’t try to do anything special. The hardest task for me is not touching my curls while they dry. I want to constantly fiddle with them and that’s a big no no! 

My hair wasn’t great, but the time it takes me to get ready in the morning has been cut down drastically! I can hit snooze for the 10th time, Chris is a saint for sleeping next to me every night & dealing with my snooze addiction, or if I’m feeling like an overachiever get up and meet my friend Ben at the gym. 

I have some products and accessories arriving this week. I’m hoping things will start to look up, and by things I mean curls, because I don’t know how long I can stare at my curling iron with my hair looking like this.
