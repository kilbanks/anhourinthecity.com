Alright y’all, I’m not going to lie I’m getting real bored. I do appreciate how little time it takes me to get ready & I love that I don’t mind rocking my natural curls now. I’m learning to appreciate my hair for what it is - a wavy mess. The Tigi product works best on my hair so far, but it also makes it the most crunchy. Not really an adjective one wants applied to their hair. My new nickname could be Captain Crunch. I ordered a few new products & am looking forward to trying them for the next week. I bet you’re all twisted with impatience wondering what’s going to happen. I know I am - let’s hope my hair will be too!

On a positive note, I went camping by the beach this weekend, and it was fitting to let my hair truly become a rats nest. My friend convinced me to take a plunge into the ocean (I’m easily tempted with a wade) and the salt water made my hair dry beautifully! Mother Nature blessed me with her _organic_ sea salt spray and it worked wonders! My hair dried in soft waves, and I was feeling myself all night! Cue the sunset beach photoshoot below - lots of beer helped with that too.
