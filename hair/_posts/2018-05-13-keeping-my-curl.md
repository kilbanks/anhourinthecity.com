title: Keeping My Curl
thumbnail: Day 7-13

Forgive me follicle, for I have sinned...that's right...I used a hot tool!! Please save your persecution for the end of this blog post! 

This week went fairly well in terms of rebuilding the natural curl. I definitely am loving the Tigi Bed Head product the most. It has been shaping beautiful curls - but like all good things they seem to come to an end by 5pm. For the first half of the day my hair will look great, but by the end of the day it's a frizzy flat mess...just like me. I haven't quite figured out how to make them last. I have noticed that when I create a hairstyle with the top layer of my hair up, the bottom curls look lovely and stay all day! I'm in the process of trying to get my top layer to behave in the same way. 

Okay - now the for the _twist_ to this post - my betrayal to my challenge! It was for a good reason,or so I tell myself (which is how most good stories and bad hangovers start.) I bought this temporary rose gold toner to spray in my hair, and I really wanted to see what it looked like quickly. Good things come to those who wait or those who blow dry. I'm going back to no hot tools, but it was like a hit of morphine. I got a small taste of my tamed, smooth curls & I want more!! Alas, I'm going to hang in there -just like the sometimes perfect, sometimes awful curls on my head.
